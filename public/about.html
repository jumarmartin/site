            double major, probably in one of the humanities above&mdash;graduate
            summa cum laude (hopefully), and then work on changing the world,
            somehow.

        1: George Hotz, of PS3 and iPhone jailbreaking fame and also of
        comma.ai, said that "politics are for losers." I'm not sure how I feel
        about that. <br />
        2: My friends would rather me say "teach" but I like "lecture" because
        it sounds better.
